## Project Overview
- I bought this T-Bird froma buy in Watsonville, CA. Fired right up, had basically straight pipes with glass pack (cherry bomb) mufflers and it was loud as heck. Should have been a giveaway that something was really wrong when he told me it didn't have revers

## Current Tasks
- rebuilding the front steering and suspension. It was making an alarming clunk over bumps, and the lower ball joints were definitely cooked. 

## Up Next
- Getting an alignment with all my new steering parts
- New Wheels and Tires
- Window trim, door seals


## Work Log

### 08/04/2025
- Started pressing in bushings, very satisfying
- even my wonky arm accepted the bushing with a little violence
- removed the strut rods, and the sway bar came out with it naturally. They're real rusty
- I'm missing some bump stops on the strut rod on one side, and I desproyed the one ot the UCA ball joint bolt accidentally
  - I guess I wonder how necessary they are? I mean they were installed from factory so they must be a good-ish idea
  - not sure if I can source replacements

### 07/25/2025
- Just lots to paint, finished painting the control arms, brake brackets, hub dust cap, etc.
- Sandblasted and painted the rotor shields

### 07/24/2025
- Continued sandblasting the control arms, painted them black
- Recieved the strut rod bushings

### 07/19/2025
- started working on sand blasting and pushing the bushings outs. It went bad, I bent the fuck out of one of the arms with a hydraulic press. I felt bad. 
- I fixed the hydraulic press too, just to mess my parts up
- Sand blasting went fine, the knuckles turned out really nice, and I just love cleaning stuff up on the sand blaster


### 07/18/2025
- Totally ripped apart the suspension and steering on the t-bird, it really didn't give me too much trouble

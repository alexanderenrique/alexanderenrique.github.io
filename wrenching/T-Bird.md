## Project Overview
- I bought this T-Bird froma buy in Watsonville, CA. Fired right up, had basically straight pipes with glass pack (cherry bomb) mufflers and it was loud as heck. Should have been a giveaway that something was really wrong when he told me it didn't have revers

## Current Tasks
- rebuilding the front steering and suspension. It was making an alarming clunk over bumps, and the lower ball joints were definitely cooked.

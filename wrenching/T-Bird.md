## Project Overview
- I bought this T-Bird froma buy in Watsonville, CA. Fired right up, had basically straight pipes with glass pack (cherry bomb) mufflers and it was loud as heck. Should have been a giveaway that something was really wrong when he told me it didn't have revers

## Current Tasks
- rebuilding the front steering and suspension. It was making an alarming clunk over bumps, and the lower ball joints were definitely cooked. 

## Up Next
- Getting an alignment with all my new steering parts
- New Wheels and Tires
- Window trim, door seals


## Work Log

### 08/10/2025
- Put everything back together, big day. 
- It's all nice and tight in the suspension, but the rattle is still there!! I'm not sure what's causing it but I'll get to the bottom of it
- Double checked the shocks and everything, current though is that something is just loose inside the body work
- I also learned the parking break disengage is vacuum operated, so now that needs to be done manually if you want to remove the parking brake.
- The fucking rattle just can't be suspension related, there must be some loose bolts or something in there

### 08/08/2025
- Started putting everything back on the car! This is the good bit where the painted shiny stuff goes together
- Everything went smooth, had to do some work jogging my memory on how the sway bar went in and how the brakes go together
- The drivers side *crushed* LCA definitely has more play than the other side, but I was able to tighten the bolt to the point where it grabbed the inner part of the bushing and will hold. 
- Did my best to alight the UCAs where they were before, and keep the tie rods to the correct length. 
- The strut rods are interesting becasue it seems like they aren't really meant to be adjusted. Often you have nuts on either side of the bushing to move the rod forward and back relative to the car, but this one doesn't have that. 
- The strut rods don't line up with the LCA until you tigthen them down and pull them forward
- I'm refraining from tightening any bushings until it's sitting at ride height

### 08/07/2025
- Sand balsted the tie rod adjusting sleeves and painted them, they look nice

### 08/06/2025
- Sand blasted and painted the strut rods. 
- Removed the tie rod ends, they were super easy to unthread which was surprising
- With the bare minimum of inner tie rods installed, I gave the rack a wiggle and everything else feels pretty gand tight. There is a little bit of lash in the steering box, but really quite good on the old car scale
- Not finding any good replacements for the bump stops but I don't think I'll let that hold me back, just gonna send it. They can be added later if I really want


### 08/04/2025
- Started pressing in bushings, very satisfying
- even my wonky arm accepted the bushing with a little violence
- removed the strut rods, and the sway bar came out with it naturally. They're real rusty
- I'm missing some bump stops on the strut rod on one side, and I desproyed the one ot the UCA ball joint bolt accidentally
  - I guess I wonder how necessary they are? I mean they were installed from factory so they must be a good-ish idea
  - not sure if I can source replacements

### 07/25/2025
- Just lots to paint, finished painting the control arms, brake brackets, hub dust cap, etc.
- Sandblasted and painted the rotor shields

### 07/24/2025
- Continued sandblasting the control arms, painted them black
- Recieved the strut rod bushings

### 07/19/2025
- started working on sand blasting and pushing the bushings outs. It went bad, I bent the fuck out of one of the arms with a hydraulic press. I felt bad. 
- I fixed the hydraulic press too, just to mess my parts up
- Sand blasting went fine, the knuckles turned out really nice, and I just love cleaning stuff up on the sand blaster


### 07/18/2025
- Totally ripped apart the suspension and steering on the t-bird, it really didn't give me too much trouble

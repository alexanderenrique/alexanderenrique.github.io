# 3D Model Files (STL)

This directory contains STL files for custom 3D printed parts and tools used in automotive projects.

## Current Models

### Thunderbird Restoration Project
- `thunderbird-rear-ashtray-blank.stl` - Blank off plate for rear ashtrays
- `thunderbird-wiper-knob.stl` - Replacement windshield wiper control knob

1. **Download** the STL file you need
2. **Import** into your 3D slicing software (Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.)
3. **Print** using appropriate settings for your material
4. **Post-process** as needed (sanding, painting, etc.)

## File Naming Convention

Files are named with the format: `project-part-description.stl`

Examples:

- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Supports**: Where needed
- **Material**: PLA/PETG recommended

## Adding New Models

1. **Design** your part in your 3D software
2. **Export** as STL file
3. **Name** following the convention above
4. **Place** in appropriate project folder
5. **Create** rendering images (see `assets/renderings/`)
6. **Update** the corresponding project page

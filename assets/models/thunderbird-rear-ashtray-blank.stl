# This is a placeholder for the actual STL file
# In reality, this would be a binary STL file exported from Fusion 360, Blender, etc.
# 
# To add your actual STL files:
# 1. Export from your 3D software as STL
# 2. Place the file here with the same name
# 3. Commit to git
# 
# Example: thunderbird-rear-ashtray-blank.stl

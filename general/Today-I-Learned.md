# Today I Learned

I'm learning just all the time and I think it's cool to look back and see what you learned and when. Just a simple list. 

## Learnings

- in PlatformIO and C/C++ header files are a lot like modules in python. Or like utils so that's where you put stuf you want to use globally
- I think I learned about build flags, but not sure I get it yet
- if there's errors in your IDE and lots of red lines it probably means your shit is broken
- learned about MISO, MOSI, IRQ, and general SPI interface stuff

  
#### 07/22/2025
- If you need .env and pydantic is being a dick about it, just export it

#### 07/21/2025
- Started this blog! learned about Jekyll and hosting pages on GitHub. I feel cool
- Pydantic is useful because it can super quickly enforce things. You could write lengthy code to enforce types, but Pydantic reduces the boilerplate code you need

#### 07/20/2025
- The best way to remove bushings is to destroy them
  - always start by heating the rubber to get it to release from the metal
  - Push out the rubber, or drill it out, or if you want cancer sooner just burn it out and carbonize it
  - Then remove the shell of the bushing by cutting a groove in it and hammering it out
  - Air hammers work ok, not as well as you'd want. Maybe mine just isn't that strong

#### 07/19/2025
- You can bend the hell out of a control arm with a hydralic press. You can't just push the center of a bushing as hard as you can and hope it pops out
- MOSI/MISO. Master in slave out, slave out master in. 
- About the stack of code you need to go from arduino IDE to a proper gui
  - It's the driver for the screen, then a graphics package (like LVGL), and then a GUI editor
  - Screens are actually kind of hard
- It's a pain in the ass to set up arduino IDE in VS Code or Cursor

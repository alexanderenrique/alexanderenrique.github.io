# Today I Learned

I'm learning just all the time and I think it's cool to look back and see what you learned and when. Just a simple list. 

## Learnings

#### 08/17/2025
- working with github pages I started learning about layouts of webpages and .scss files

#### 08/10/2025
- I learned about jumbo mortgage loans, anything above about $1.1 million in the bay area
- 

#### 08/05/2025
- the google Oath doesn't work so well with a headless set up like in cron job. It needs to constantly open new oprts or whatever on the local host for authentication. It would work for a couple hours and then silently fail
- Service accounts are the way to go for Cron Jobs

#### 08/05/2025
- Messing with the cron job I feel like I have a much better grasp of interacting with the terminal and using nano to modify files. I don't know many commands but definiely the common useful ones. 

#### 08/04/2025
- there are limits to the max power your wifi is allowed to have, set by the FCC. Basically if any one person has too powerful a device it can mess things up for everyone
- You can buy ESP32s without the integrated wifi antenna, and plug your own antennae in.
- The C3s just have totally horrible antenna, they don't connect for shit
- The programming language GO, I wonder if it could help me speed up some algo stuff. 
- cronjobs, set up my first one on the collector computer

#### 07/30/2025
- learned about serial communications, man that stuff is cool. Synchronous, a synchronous, UART, I2C, SPI. It's like you use it and kinda know what's happening but cool to learn it
- 
#### 07/28/2025
- MQTT and how that works, kinda
- Started learning about PRAM and the best way to drive displays
- Sometimes deleting a token and reauthenticating is the way to go
- Manually advancing the LVGL clock will solce your problems
- Started learning about Data Structures and algorithms. Learned about "bigO" and the complexity of running nested loops, like how that increases exponentially
- Kinda started on recursive algorithms but those my my head in a knot

#### 07/25/2025
- reflecting on a past learning, I got all mad at the higher ups because they weren't doing shit, but sometimes the higher ups are also fed up because their higher ups aren't doing shit. So while it's important for your voice to be heard, maybe give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe. 

#### 07/24/2025
- learned about glancing angle xray spectroscopy for very thin films


#### 07/23/2025
- in PlatformIO and C/C++ header files are a lot like modules in python. Or like utils so that's where you put stuf you want to use globally
- I think I learned about build flags, but not sure I get it yet
- if there's errors in your IDE and lots of red lines it probably means your shit is broken
- learned about MISO, MOSI, IRQ, and general SPI interface stuff

  
#### 07/22/2025
- If you need .env and pydantic is being a dick about it, just export it

#### 07/21/2025
- Started this blog! learned about Jekyll and hosting pages on GitHub. I feel cool
- Pydantic is useful because it can super quickly enforce things. You could write lengthy code to enforce types, but Pydantic reduces the boilerplate code you need

#### 07/20/2025
- The best way to remove bushings is to destroy them
  - always start by heating the rubber to get it to release from the metal
  - Push out the rubber, or drill it out, or if you want cancer sooner just burn it out and carbonize it
  - Then remove the shell of the bushing by cutting a groove in it and hammering it out
  - Air hammers work ok, not as well as you'd want. Maybe mine just isn't that strong

#### 07/19/2025
- You can bend the hell out of a control arm with a hydralic press. You can't just push the center of a bushing as hard as you can and hope it pops out
- MOSI/MISO. Master in slave out, slave out master in. 
- About the stack of code you need to go from arduino IDE to a proper gui
  - It's the driver for the screen, then a graphics package (like LVGL), and then a GUI editor
  - Screens are actually kind of hard
- It's a pain in the ass to set up arduino IDE in VS Code or Cursor

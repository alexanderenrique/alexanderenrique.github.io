- Make content easily searchable and interconnected
- Keep the tech stack simple but extensible
- Focus on styling AND content

## Work Log

### 10/03/2025
- Added tagging and a couple of general pages
- Added the swanky flow chart to the NEMO MQTT Plugin page, I just want things to look pretty and be functional

### 10/02/2025
- Purchased domain name for blog
- Configured DNS records to point to GitHub Pages
- Added CNAME file to repository
- Configured my Github to work with the DNS which is a learning experience in itself.

### 10/01/2025
- Migrated from basic Markdown/GitHub Pages to [[11ty]]
- Implemented base template and layout system
- Added Mermaid.js for diagram support
- Created initial navigation structure

### July-September 2025
- I've heard a lot of techy people talk about how good it is to document your work, so I decided to try it. 
- It started small, just learning about Markdown generally. Then I wanted to publish it somewhere, and GitHub Pages was a good option.
- I started with some themes from github pages and Jekyll, but was unhappy with the styling.
- Then I moved to MkDocs, which was nicer and technical but I just wanted my blog to be pretty
- So then I moved to 11ty which is when things got good. 

### Future Plans
- Improving the tagging system, and how pages are connected
- Reading my old work logs, make sure they even make sense and are up to snuff

## Technical Stack
- Static Site Generator: 11ty
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Content: Markdown with Obsidian-style links

## Mechanical Projects
- Repurpose a 3D printer into a CNC router  
- 3D print:
  - Dimple dies  
  - Cone expander  
  - Watch holder  
- Fuse 3D printed filament together (e.g. splicing/joining technique)
- Set up digitization station for diaries  

## Programming / Software
- **NEMO Features**
  - Leaderboard for Amount of publications
  - Publications feature: scrape ArXiv and cross-reference lab members  
  - Create NEMO data dashboard  
  - Add processing techniques from ArXiv to repository
  - Something to actually read my handwritting, training an LLM
  - 
- **Smart Assistants & Bots**
  - Voice commands to interact with the Thunderbird (e.g. ask car status)  
  - Scrape personal emails to create a personalized email response bot  
- **Productivity & Quantified Self**
  - ESP32-CAM to monitor time spent at desk daily  
  - Strava API: calories burned per day  
- **Infrastructure & Systems**
  - Pi-hole DNS for home  
  - Inventory management system better than spreadsheets  

## Microelectronics / Embedded Systems
- DIY 1.5V transistor radio  
- Voice notification system:
  - Detect who walks by office or sits on couch (e.g. with ESP32-CAM or sensors)  
- **Lucca Couch Sensor System**
  - Detect when Lucca is on the couch  
  - LED or haptic feedback at desk  
- **Smart Load Cell Scale**
  - Auto-tare with button  
  - Average last X values  
  - Faster polling if weight below threshold  
  - Set variable as zero dynamically  
- **ESP32 Screen With Next Reservation**
  - A simple screen above every tool that shows the next reservation on NEMO
- Nixie tube clock  

## Miscellaneous / Fun
- “Player Hater’s Ball 2003 Parking” sticker

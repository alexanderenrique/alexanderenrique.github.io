## Overview
Stuff that doesn't fit into any other category. Things like painting a house, or installing door knobs, or other very miscellaneous stuff. I think I just like writing.

**Category:** Home Improvement

**Task:** Fixing doors not latching, installing task light in kitchen

**Notes:**
- The hall door and guestroom door haven't latched for some time, and the bathroom door was hard to open and close
- Removed the handles and striker plates, in most cases I needed to router out the striker plate part to give myself enough up and down movement to get it to latch 
- Did a proper job and painted everything before the final install
- Installed the task light in the kitchen, it works fine. Still looks silly to have two lights in there but whatever.

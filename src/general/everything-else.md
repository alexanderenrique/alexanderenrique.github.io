## Overview
Stuff that doesn't fit into any other category. Things like painting a house, or installing door knobs, or other very miscellaneous stuff. I think I just like writing.

### 11/18/2025
**Category:** Home Improvement

**Task:** Bathroom remodelling

**Notes:**
- Continued on the trim, sure is fiddly
- Started on the sink install, many challenges to overcome
  - The drain outlet from the wall clashed with the rear support bar on the vanity, so I had to remove some of that support
  - Then the P trap didn't limeup with the bottom of the sink, so I had to find the right flex join.
  - But by adding the flex joint I had to shorten the drain from the bottom of the sink
- Also replaced the leaking cold side valve from the wall which involved shutting the water off to the whole house
- Mocked up the vanity and mirror, with a little luck everything will fit. The light is low on the wall, the mirror is tall, and the vanity is also tall so the three of those are a tight squeeze.

**Task:** Bathroom remodelling

**Notes:**
- Slowly becoming a trim carpenter, man it's time consuming and tedious to get it just right. 
- Started nailing on some of the ship lap
- Vanity assembly is almost done, Amanda worked really ahrd on that. 
- Hoping the plumbing stuff comes soon so we can have a functional sink.

## 11/15/2025
**Category:** Home Improvement

**Task:** Bathroom remodelling

**Notes:**
- Amanda has been hard at work instlalling new stick on flooring tiles, they look good from afar, but just the nature of the tiles means there are some gaps and pattern challenges
- Started sutting ship lap, making holes for outlets and water and other things
- The vanity came totally dissassembled so that's going to add a lot of time to this project. There's so many steps and each one has a million fasteners.
- Chose a green paint for the ship lap, "dried rosemary" it looks nice, really happy with it.
- Oh and Amanad painted the whole top half of the walls nano white, and removed the caulking from the shower, and the caulk took half the dry wall with it so she added spackling back. 

### 10/19/2025
**Category:** Home Improvement

**Task:** Fixing doors not latching, installing task light in kitchen

**Notes:**
- The hall door and guestroom door haven't latched for some time, and the bathroom door was hard to open and close
- Removed the handles and striker plates, in most cases I needed to router out the striker plate part to give myself enough up and down movement to get it to latch 
- Did a proper job and painted everything before the final install
- Installed the task light in the kitchen, it works fine. Still looks silly to have two lights in there but whatever.

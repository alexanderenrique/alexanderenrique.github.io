## Work Log

### 10/03/2025
**Category:** Miscellaneous

**Task:** Cleaning up the garage, Fixing the Isuzu Rear View Mirror, Fixing the Isuzu Tailgate

**Notes:**
- Cleaned the garage. It was a mess.
- The rear view mirror was falling off, so I learned how that works. After years of ratting I solved it. Missing and loose bolts, always something like that.
- One of three bolts was missing so I replaced and tightened them all. Added some VHB tape to where the mirror clips on to the base for good measure. No more rattle!
- The tailgate decided to get stuck for the first time ever which was weird. The thick rod that actuates the latch had fallen off at the handle. I had to remove the rear latch cover to fix it. I was pretty mad and just started kicking stuff. Not the way to do it. Lubed everything while I was in there.

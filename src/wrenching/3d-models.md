## How to Use These Models

1. **Browse** the models below to see what's available
2. **Download** the STL file you need
3. **Import** into your 3D slicing software (UltiMaker Cura, or Creality Slicer)
4. **Print** using the recommended settings
5. **Post-process** as needed (I never do any, but you might want to)

## Print Settings

Most parts are designed for:
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Supports**: Use your brain
- **Material**: PLA for basically everything
- **Build Plate**: 200°C, 60°C

## T-Bird Designs

### Rear Ashtray Blank Off Plate

**Description**: Custom blank off plate to replace the brittle rear ashtrays in the 1968 Thunderbird. Designed to just kind of cover the opening. I used 1/4" VHB tape to stick it to the interior sheet metal trim

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-rear-ashtray-blankoff.stl)

**Material**: PLA/PETG  
**Installation**: VHB tape mounting  
**Status**: Completed and installed

### Windshield Wiper Knob

**Description**: Replacement for the broken windshield wiper control knob. Matches the original design and fits the existing shaft. - see thunderbird-restoration

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-wiper-knob.stl)

**Material**: PLA  
**Installation**: Press fit onto wiper control shaft  
**Status**: Completed and installed

### Center Console Cup Holder

<img src="/images/thunderbird-cup-holder.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: Custom cup holder insert that fits in the center console ashtray space. Designed to hold modern beverage containers. The center console isn't quite square, and neither is this, it does have a slight taper of the base to fit better. - see thunderbird-restoration 

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-cup-holder.stl)

**Material**: PLA is fine, I've had no trouble with PLA inside my car.  
**Installation**: Sits in the center console, underneath the lockable arm rest 
**Status**: Completed and installed

## Tooling

### 2.5" v-band cap

<img src="/images/male-vband-25-cap.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: A **male** cap designed to fit 2.5" v-band flanges for purge welding. When welding stainless steel or other materials that require back-purging with inert gas, this cap creates a seal against the v-band flange. Includes a small port for gas outlet. The flow port is the decimal of the 2.5 on the face of the flange. I thought that was pretty clever. I designed this and never really tested it, not a big purge welding guy, just never really have the need. 

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/male-vband-25-cap.stl)

**Material**: You'll want to keep this far from your weld, lest it melt, but I guess you could use some higher temp filament. I used PLA. 

**Installation**: Clamps onto v-band flange with standard clamp  

## 2002 Yamaha FZ-1

### Yoshimura Flange Adapter

<img src="/images/FZ1-yoshimura-rs3-flange-adapter.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**GD&T Drawing**: [Yoshi-Drawing.pdf](/images/Yoshi-Drawing.pdf)

**Description**: This one will probably get me a cease and desist but whatever. It's a flange to adapt a 2.5" exhaust pipe, like say a midpipe on an FZ1, to the 3 bolt flange found on a Yoshimura RS3 muffler. You can send it to your favorite laser cutting service and they'll cut you one out of stainless steel to then weld onto your custom midpipe. I found that a 2.5" SS pipe with a few lengthwise cuts gives it just enough wiggle to slide over the header box outlet thing.

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/FZ1-yoshimura-rs3-flange-adapter.stl)

**Material**: Test print it from whatever, but you'll need to get it laser cut from stainless steel. 
**Installation**: Weld to your custom midpipe. 
**Status**: Tested and working

## How Tags Work

Tags with `#` prefix (like `#thunderbird`) create **cross-references** between related projects. For example:

- The Thunderbird restoration project is connected to the Smart Thunderbird electronics project through the `#thunderbird` tag
- 3D printing projects are linked to restoration work through the `#3d-printing` tag
- Lab management projects are interconnected through the `#nemo` tag

## Tag Relationships

The tag system creates a knowledge graph where:

1. **Direct tags** describe the content of each page
2. **Cross-reference tags** (with #) link to related projects
3. **Related content** is automatically suggested based on shared tags
4. **Backlinks** show which pages reference the current content

This creates an Obsidian-style knowledge base where you can discover connections between different projects and ideas!

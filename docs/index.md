# Welcome to Bits and Bolts

Welcome to my blog about **wrenching**, **coding**, and **microelectronics** projects! This is where I document my adventures in turning wrenches, writing code, and building circuits.

## What You'll Find Here

### Wrenching Projects
Classic car restoration and mechanical projects. Currently working on a **1968 Thunderbird** restoration - see [[thunderbird-restoration]] for details.

### Coding Projects
Software tools and automation projects, including **NEMO lab management** tools and **AI chatbots** - see [[NEMO Merger]] and [[WorkLog Bot]] for details.

### Microelectronics
Modern electronics integration for classic cars and embedded systems projects - see [[Smart-T-Bird]] for the Thunderbird electronics project.

### General Knowledge
Daily learnings, project ideas, and miscellaneous thoughts - see [[Today-I-Learned]] for daily discoveries.

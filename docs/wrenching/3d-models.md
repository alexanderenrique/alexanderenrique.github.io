# 3D Models & STL Files

Welcome to the 3D Models section! Here you'll find all the custom 3D printed parts and tools I've designed for automotive projects.

## How to Use These Models

1. **Browse** the models below to see what's available
2. **Download** the STL file you need
3. **Import** into your 3D slicing software (Cura, PrusaSlicer, etc.)
4. **Print** using the recommended settings
5. **Post-process** as needed (sanding, painting, etc.)

## Print Settings

Most parts are designed for:
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Supports**: Where needed
- **Material**: PLA/PETG recommended
- **Build Plate**: 200°C, 60°C

## [[thunderbird-restoration]] Project

### Rear Ashtray Blank Off Plate
<img src="../../assets/renderings/thunderbird-rear-ashtray-blankoff.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: Custom blank off plate to replace the brittle rear ashtrays in the 1968 Thunderbird. Designed to just kind of cover the opening. I used 1/4" VHB tape to stick it to the interior sheet metal trim - see [[thunderbird-restoration]]

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-rear-ashtray-blankoff.stl)

**Material**: PLA/PETG  
**Installation**: VHB tape mounting  
**Status**: Completed and installed  
**Date Added**: August 2024

**Description**: Replacement for the broken windshield wiper control knob. Matches the original design and fits the existing shaft. - see [[thunderbird-restoration]]

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-wiper-knob.stl)

**Material**: PLA  
**Installation**: Press fit onto wiper control shaft  
**Status**: Completed and installed  
**Date Added**: July 2024

### Center Console Cup Holder

<img src="../../assets/renderings/thunderbird-cup-holder.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: Custom cup holder insert that fits in the center console ashtray space. Designed to hold modern beverage containers. The center console isn't quite square, and neither is this, it does have a slight taper of the base to fit better. - see [[thunderbird-restoration]] 

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/thunderbird-cup-holder.stl)

**Material**: PLA is fine, I've had no trouble with PLA inside my car.  
**Installation**: Sits in the center console, underneath the lockable arm rest 
**Status**: Completed and installed  
**Date Added**: August 2025

## Tooling

### 2.5" v band cap

<img src="../../assets/renderings/vband-25-cap.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: A **MALE** cap designed to fit 2.5" v-band flanges for purge welding. When welding stainless steel or other materials that require back-purging with inert gas, this cap creates a seal against the v-band flange. Includes a small port for gas outlet. The flow port is the decimal of the 2.5 on the face of the flange. I thought that was pretty clever. I designed this and never really tested it, not a big purge welding guy, just never really have the need. 

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/male-vband-25-cap.stl)

**Material**: PETG recommended for heat resistance  
**Installation**: Clamps onto v-band flange with standard clamp  
**Status**: Tested and working  
**Date Added**: August 2024

## 2002 Yamaha FZ-1

### Yoshimura Flange Adapter

<img src="../../assets/renderings/FZ1-yoshimura-rs3-flange-adapter.png" alt="3D Preview" width="400" height="300" style="border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin: 10px 0;">

**Description**: This one will probably get me a cease and desist but whatever. It's a flange to adapt a 2.5" exhaust pipe, like say a midpipe on an FZ1, to the 3 bolt flange found on a Yoshimura RS3 muffler. You can send it to your favorit laser cutting service and they'll cut you one out of stanless steel to then weld onto your exhaust.

**STL File**: [Download STL](../../assets/models/FZ1-yoshimura-rs3-flange-adapter.stl)

**Material**: High-temp PETG or similar heat-resistant filament  
**Installation**: Bolts between stock header and slip-on using existing hardware  
**Status**: Tested and working  
**Date Added**: July 2024

# 1968 Thunderbird Work Log

## Project Overview
- I bought this T-Bird from a guy in Watsonville, CA. Fired right up, had basically straight pipes with glasspack (cherry bomb) mufflers and it was loud as heck. Should have been a giveaway that something was really wrong when he told me it didn't have reverse

## Current Tasks
- 3D print passenger side blank off plate
- design know for driver side sun shade so it doesn't rattle
- window switches
- Oil leak from front of engine
- "knee breeze" cable
- Switching between defrost and forward vent
- Getting some fix a flat in a can in case of flat



## Before My Birthday Road Trip
- Tire change kit
- organize spare kit
- securing liquids in trunk
- leaking trans (New fittings, hoses, trans pan)
- Vinyl wrap
- Bonus:
  - Adding speakers to the back
  - Oil Pan with turbo bung



## Work Log

### 09/30/2025
- Made a mounting bracket for the vacuum control headlight switch, started plumbing it in.
### 09/27-28/25
- Not really an update, but I drove it 450 miles down and back from Pismo and it worked just about flawlessly. A few issues and things that I want to fix, but all in all really solid and I'm happy about it.
- No obvious leaks from the trans but I still need to get under it and really check
- Some small leak from the front of the engine, could be oil pan or fron main seal. 

### 09/26/2025
- Finished installing the passenger seat belt
- Wired up the 6x9s that were previously under the front seats into the back. I was able to kind of wedge them betwwen the wheel arch and the back of the parcel shelf, and the magnet in the speaker kinda helps them stay. I guess they're in there

### 09/25/2025
- Went to the tire shop and got new tires, they absolutely fuck they look so sick. I put them on and I really like the steely look. But then I put the hubcaps on and it felt even more right
- Finished mounging the seatbelf on the passenger side
- Finished installing the speaker cups. They do sound worse than the 6x9s, but at least the seat move freely now the way they should. I think that's worth it to me. 

### 09/24/2025
- Got it back from the alignment shop, might just be my perception but it feels like genearlly way tighter. Not only pulling straight and steering straight, but less clunks.

### 09/23/2025
- reprinted the speaker cup, it's the right depth now
- Dropped the t bird off at the alignment shop, should be done tomorrow
- took the old steel tires to the tire shop and they dismounted them for me, now just a shit load of hours with the wire wheel and painting before the trip. Tires come in tomorrow.

### 09/22/2025
- Somehow the speaker cup that I made was too shallow. Not sure how that happened, I really measued with a straight edge and I thought I gave myself clearence. Went from 1.75" to 2.1" cup depth.

### 09/21/2025
- Rough day on the t-bird, making progress but certainley trying.
- I tried the new NPSM fitting, and it threads in but it still has a slight taper! Like 40 thou but the factory is truly straight, I'm losing my mind with it. 
- So I cut it down and then tried to slam the fitting in, but that's when it wouldn't go in even a little and I realized the taper issue
- In my attempt to force it in, I kind of rolled the threads inside inside the trans and I couldn't get the old fitting in.
- Started losing hope but I chipped away at it, kinda unrolled it with a pick and cleaned it out, but it came good eventually, super stressful I was kicking myself
- Got it all back together
- Swapped the trans pans, the bolts on the old trans pan were straigh loose! yeah that'd cause a leak, but whatever I still installed the new pan and gasket
- Went in fine, does seem to be slightly deeper but not massively, I think it's fine. It'll take a lot of fluid to fill, at least 6 quarts came out.
- Pulled the seats and started figuring out how I want to do the seat belts.
- Not going to be easy, will be making some modifications to the seat trim, but I want to do it safely and not compromise that. 
- While I was at it I went on a side quest to figure out why the seats don't slide. It's the massive 6x9s and the box, like I thought. 
- So I tested my small speakers, and they will fit nicely underneath the seats. I'd rather have the seats slide than great speakers up front.
- I might put the old 6x9s in the back if I can fit them somehow.
- 

### 09/09/2025
- Pulled the fittings for the trans cooler, turns out they are 1/4" NPSM, not 1/8 NPSM, so I bough a different adapter to go from 1/4" NPSM to -6AN to fit my 90 degree fitting

### 08/25/2025
- printed another blank off plate, used the last of four different spools of white

### 08/24/2025
- Designed and 3D printed a blank off plate for the rear ashtrays, use VHB tape and it's really stuck on there. Nice

### 08/20/2025
- After a bit of time away, I received the rubber isolators and installed them. Behold, no more terrible rattle. 
- I did notice that the "top" spring clip on both brake calipers was broken. I thought it was a feature the last few times I removed it, turns out just straight broken. I'll replace them some day maybe. I left the passenger side, and just removed the driver side to avoid it rattling around loose. I realized it on the second side, the drivers side
- Measured up the rear speaker area, the hole is something like 5" square. Really unsure how it mounts
- removed the rear ashtrays, and added some foam strips to take up any slack between the metal and the bolstering that could cause a rattle
- I do like the ashtrays, but the plastic they are made out of is just so brittle and I don't think it's worth it to try and fix it. I'll design and 3D print a blank off plate so it looks complete

### 08/13/2025
- Sometimes you just have to step away for a bit. It was the brakes!
- I did a test where I hit a bunch of bumps while very lightly hitting the brakes, not a rattle, certainly not the loose change sound
- I did some googling and it looks like I'm totally missing these rubber isolators that go on the slide pins. They weren't there when I took the brakes apart
- I can't wait for them to arrive, about a week though.

### 08/10/2025
- Put everything back together, big day. 
- It's all nice and tight in the suspension, but the rattle is still there!! I'm not sure what's causing it but I'll get to the bottom of it
- Double checked the shocks and everything, current though is that something is just loose inside the body work
- I also learned the parking brake disengagement is vacuum operated, so now that needs to be done manually if you want to remove the parking brake.
- The fucking rattle just can't be suspension related, there must be some loose bolts or something in there

### 08/08/2025
- Started putting everything back on the car! This is the good bit where the painted shiny stuff goes together
- Everything went smooth, had to do some work jogging my memory on how the sway bar went in and how the brakes go together
- The driver's side *crushed* LCA definitely has more play than the other side, but I was able to tighten the bolt to the point where it grabbed the inner part of the bushing and will hold. 
- Did my best to align the UCAs where they were before, and keep the tie rods to the correct length. 
- The strut rods are interesting because it seems like they aren't really meant to be adjusted. Often you have nuts on either side of the bushing to move the rod forward and back relative to the car, but this one doesn't have that. 
- The strut rods don't line up with the LCA until you tighten them down and pull them forward
- I'm refraining from tightening any bushings until it's sitting at ride height

### 08/07/2025
- Sand blasted the tie rod adjusting sleeves and painted them, they look nice

### 08/06/2025
- Sand blasted and painted the strut rods. 
- Removed the tie rod ends, they were super easy to unthread which was surprising
- With the bare minimum of inner tie rods installed, I gave the rack a wiggle and everything else feels pretty good and tight. There is a little bit of lash in the steering box, but really quite good on the old car scale
- Not finding any good replacements for the bump stops but I don't think I'll let that hold me back, just gonna send it. They can be added later if I really want


### 08/04/2025
- Started pressing in bushings, very satisfying
- even my wonky arm accepted the bushing with a little violence
- removed the strut rods, and the sway bar came out with it naturally. They're real rusty
- I'm missing some bump stops on the strut rod on one side, and I destroyed the one on the UCA ball joint bolt accidentally
  - I guess I wonder how necessary they are? I mean they were installed from factory so they must be a good-ish idea
  - not sure if I can source replacements

### 07/25/2025
- Just lots to paint, finished painting the control arms, brake brackets, hub dust cap, etc.
- Sandblasted and painted the rotor shields

### 07/24/2025
- Continued sandblasting the control arms, painted them black
- Received the strut rod bushings

### 07/19/2025
- started working on sand blasting and pushing the bushings out. It went bad, I bent the fuck out of one of the arms with a hydraulic press. I felt bad. 
- I fixed the hydraulic press too, just to mess my parts up
- Sand blasting went fine, the knuckles turned out really nice, and I just love cleaning stuff up on the sand blaster


### 07/18/2025
- Totally ripped apart the suspension and steering on the t-bird, it really didn't give me too much trouble

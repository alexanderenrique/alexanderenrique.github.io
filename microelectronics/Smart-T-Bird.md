## Project Overview
- I love me some data, micro electronics, and old cars so let's put them all together. 
- My dream is to have temperature data, PWM control of fans, and a cool hidden display where I can see all the readouts and what everything is doing, and also manually override sensors if say I want to put a fan on full blast or whatever else

## Scope of work:
### Sensors and controllers I want:
- Coolant temp and PWM fan control
- Trans cooler temp and PWM fan control
- Oil Temperature
- Battery voltage
- Display that is getting all the data wirelessly from the sensor network
- The sensor should autodim based on light conditions
- Bonues
  - Diff temp
  - fuel pressure eventually
  - drive shaft speed, could inform other parts of the project

## Current Tasks
- Figuring out the LGVL package on the ESP32
- Getting the arduino IDE set up

## Up Next

### 07/22/2025
- made a branch in Jeff's repo for my PlatformIO project, I think that is the way to go as opposed to Arduino CLI + VSCode. I just don't want to have to configure everything manually sounds scary
- Started playing with PlatformIO
